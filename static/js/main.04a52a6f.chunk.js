While many might not see the inherent value in pursuing this second facet of mine, I can say without a doubt that these studies have been instrumental (pun intended) to my growth as a developer and a person as a whole. My explorations in music let me work with a multitude of different personalities, giving me fantastic exposure to the world outside of engineering. In addition, music stretches my communication abilities, as we often discuss abstract concepts, ambiguous techniques, and emotional expression.

This is my first public recording; hopefully you, my imaginary viewer, enjoy it. When this was recorded, I was at a point in my vocal development where I struggled to stay "on my voice". While this recording might sound good from a theatre perspective, it lacks the consistent, full sound required for a classical rendition of this piece. I was, however, pleased with the characterization I managed to bring to the table. While my gestures aren't confident yet, this was my first true attempt at a piece that requires more than my typical "stand and mope" performance. It was a huge step forward, and I hope to continue putting more effort into my characterizations.

I'm dubbing my blog "Shouts to the Void" since no one will read this, and *that's exactly how I like it*. On the rare occassion that
I am inspired enough to write, this is where I'll store the result. For the most part, I aim to write about things I am currently 
learning about in an effort to better understand the topic. I fully believe that teaching is one of the best ways to learn, even 
if I am lecturing an imaginary audience. Since I am currently spending a lot of time preparing for technical interviews, I'll likely
write some articles on specific data-structures or programming techniques. I might also dive into personal motivations, goals, or 
philosophies. It's hard to say where this'll go, but in the end this will improve my writing and knowledge retention. 

Any musical work or programming project overviews / demos will be stored in the music and projects areas respectively.

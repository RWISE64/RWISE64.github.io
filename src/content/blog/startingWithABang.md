People put a lot of hope on 2021. I wasn't expecting much to be honest. *I was mistaken.*

January 2021 has to have been one of the weirdest and most exciting months of my life. It started off a bit rocky, considering our capital was invaded by a bunch of Trump supporters led by a shirtless man in a buffalo horn hat, but things got better. Joe Biden was sworn in as president, and the big event that the conspiracy theorists warned about never came. On that same day, I aced my final Amazon interview, netting myself a fantastic summer internship. I got rejected on the first interview with Facebook, which stings a bit since I got further last year... Still, I am absolutely stoked to have an internship with a FAANG company. I got recruited to work part time for a friends start up, PeachPay, which has the promise of new experiences and possibly a fantastic future. I've also seen fantastic returns on all the effort I've been putting into my programming, music, fitness, and other studies. And the final cherry on top? Some hedge funds are at risk of bankruptcy because a bunch of Redditors said "we like the stock" and sent GameStop to the moon. What a fascinating timeline we live in. It's always fun to acknowledge how absolutely bizarre our current state of affairs is. It would make a fantastic comedy, if we weren't living in it of course... Things are looking up though!

## Reflection on January

I believe I've managed to hit all of the goals I set forth in my New Year's Resolution post. I was definitely a bit last minute with my music, blog, and reflection posts, but I only gave myself half a month to do it (and implement the code for music posts). I should likely aim to make more frequent posts, which will be easier with the code in place and maybe reduced post size. 

My social life has definitely declined a bit, so I think I need to watch it a bit more this month to avoid going on another reclusive streak... I have been getting more passive social activity with school back in session though, so it is a bit less dire than it was over break. 

School has just started, and it seems I am loading myself up for my busiest semester yet. I've chosen to participate in Opera Studio again, started my role as treasurer for Iowa State Singers, agreed to work ~5 hours a week for PeachPay, and am hoping to continue utilizing my free time to better myself. Things are going well so far, but I clearly need to have a plan in place to ensure I don't fall behind.

## Goals for February

I need to focus on what I have, and avoid taking on anything more. I am being extremely ambitious, especially agreeing to work at PeachPay in addtion to my current job. However, I believe that this position will likely help me succeed at my Amazon internship, which is why I plan to put a lot of effort into it.

Foresight is the name of the game this semester. I've got to avoid slacking like last semester, as it's a slippery slope. This month has been much more rewarding than those lazy months anyway. To stay on top, I need to take some time each weekend to look at what's coming up and set some weekly goals. It's sort of like my New Year's Resolution and this post, but on a smaller scale. I've been setting daily goals, but weekly goals will give my daily plans more focus. I'll use my goal setting time to look ahead as well, so I can spot incoming work influxes before they occur.

Now for some more concrete goals for the month. I hope to get the following done:
1. Finish the JavaScript guide I'm currently exploring
2. Finish "The Pragmatic Programmer"
3. Finish the IPA for Debussy's *Trois Ballades de Fran√ßois Villon* (an extremely cool French song cycle)
4. Post a piano recording
5. "Finish" the Project section of my website
6. Make first project post on my website
7. "Finish" the About section on my website

That's about it. Another ambitious plan, but ambition leads to results.

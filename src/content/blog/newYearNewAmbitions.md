2020 has been harsh for everyone, and it seems many are pinning their hopes on a better 2021. While of course hope for a better tomorrow is important,
the cynic in me finds it a bit hard to believe that a relatively arbitrary change of date will suddenly turn the tides in our favor. For a similar
reason, I find New Year's Resolutions to often be pointless. That's not to say that having goals is foolish, but rather having a goal and no plan
on how you'll achieve it. Goals formed on a whim will likely fail as quickly as they were formed. In my limited view, many form their grand goals,
receive a pat on the back from friends for taking that step, then go right back to their old habits. I hope to have a bit more of a plan in place. 
So, in order to take another step towards the person I want to be, I'll be reflecting on my 2020, then planning my extensive aspirations for 2021.

You might be wondering how this is any different from typical a New Year's Resolution. In many ways, it's not. Still, there is a beauty to this likely-unread 
post. Since I have no way of knowing anyone has read this, I won't be receiving the early reward typically received from sharing your resolutions. 
However, there is still a chance somebody is reading this, so there is some shame in failing to achieve my goals. Additionally, I believe that having your 
goals set in stone makes it a bit more likely to stick. This post will serve as a permanent reminder of these goals. 


## Reflection on 2020
In a way, the pandemic has actually been a fantastic tool for reflection; it disrupted my life just enough to learn more about myself. I was forced to
experiment, which of course came with good and bad results.

### Need for Purpose & Concrete Goals
One of the biggest differences for me was the shift to online schooling. I initially loved online schooling, since it catered more to my own schedule. However, 
any semblance of a schedule ceased to exist, so my life became unfocused. I realized that as much as I disliked the unforgiving timeline of classes, they at 
least gave me something to focus my energy to. What I think is more important though is that I need something to work towards besides school. I was able to 
meet all of my school deadlines, but failed to make non-academic progress with the extra time the pandemic allowed me. A few overarching ideals to strive for
and concrete steps to reach them would serve me well in the coming year.

### Lack of Intelligent Ambition
I might have lied a bit in the previous paragraph. I definitely had a few things to work toward, but it was quite difficult to get started. Essentially, the 
goals I committed to were bound to fail. I had a month or two streak of learning German, missed a day, then never came back. I had big project ideas, but wasn't
able to take the first step. In the end, I failed to make progress because I ignored some of my basic human shortcomings. I need to remember that progress is more 
important than a streak, and that small but relatively-consistent steps beat the burst of progress that never comes.

### Personal Well-Being
I, like many other introverts (I assume), was shocked to find that I actually need people. Crazy, right? Turns out I was usually getting just enough interaction
during the day to cut myself off for the night. Unfortunately, that doesn't work too well in a pandemic. The pandemic forced me to see the stark difference between
my well-being with and without people. It seems like just an hour or two of interaction is more than enough for me to get by - I just need to make sure I'm taking
care of myself in other ways as well.

## Overarching Goals for 2021
I'll start with my big-picture goals, then break down how I might actually progress towards them. One of the main things to note is that I don't see these as 
achievable goals, rather my general direction. I believe that the achieved or not achieved mindset to goals is a bit toxic, as it'll make you more likely to give
up, while also making you prone to forget the progress you made along the way. If I have made some progress in each of these by the end of the year, that's a 
success in my book.

### Foster Curiousity & Love of Learning
I'd like to blame traditional schooling for killing curiousity in much of the populace, myself included. I've quickly realized that if I want to excel in software
engineering (and really anything for that matter), I need to nurture my curiousity and learn at every possible moment.

### Become a Programmer Worthy of Notice
I'm a straight A student, but I honestly can't say that I'm a good programmer in any way. I'm sure I'm better than many of my peers, but my skill level is utterly
dwarfed by the passionate. I'd love to join their ranks, which is going to take a lot more than good grades. In fact, it might require the opposite.

### Improve my Well-Being
It's about time I focus on this. In the end, my ways of coping are toxic to my ambitions. I need to ensure I have a solid base on which to build myself.

### Grow as a Musician
I have a tendency to obsess about something for a while then drop it. This certainly happened with piano; I made a ridiculous amount of progress in one year, then
fell off the boat. I'd just like to maintain and hopefully grow my fluency on my choice instruments: voice, piano, and bass.

## Concrete Goals for 2021
Here's where I'll get truly overambitious. I completely expect to fail in many respects here, but as long as I made an honest effort I'll be pleased. I plan on
utilizing the two-day rule here, as it's been working extremely well for me in the past few months. In short, rather than trying to keep a perfect streak of a new
habit, you focus on going at most two days without doing it. It makes the habit-forming process much more forgiving and gives you much needed opportunities for
rest. Additionally, I plan to make much of my tasks as minimal as possible. For example, I would consider reading a single page as "enough" reading for the day.
Of course, I'll likely read much more than that, but the important thing is to make it as easy as possible to start. Finally, I'll include some final concrete
benchmarks as well, as it can be nice to use them for deadlines.

### Foster Curiousity & Love of Learning

#### Utilize the two-day rule for the following:
- Read a page of a book
- 5 minutes of foreign language work

#### General Habits:
- Ask more questions
- Practice active learning

#### Benchmarks:
- Finish 35 books (it sounds crazy, but I somehow finished 29 last year)
- One blog post a month on something semi-academic

### Become a Programmer Worthy of Notice

#### Utilize the two-day rule for the following:
- One LeetCode problem
- Reading Docs/Practicing React/JavaScript
- GitHub project commits

#### General Habits:
- Be more focused during work
- Prioritize coding over school (when it makes sense)
- Read more computer science-based content

#### Benchmarks:
- 3 semi-complete projects
- Success at a good internship
- 400 total LeetCode problems (finshed ~140 since I started counting)

### Improve my Well-Being

#### Utilize the two-day rule for the following:
- Get 8 hours of sleep
- Floss (miniscule, but might as well)
- Exercise

#### General Habits:
- Avoid accidental (or purposeful) isolation
- Take time to reflect

#### Benchmarks:
- Write a monthly reflection blog post

### Grow as a Musician

#### Utilize the two-day rule for the following:
- 5 minute vocal practice
- 5 minute piano practice
- 5 minute bass practice

#### General Habits:
- Look for ways to change how you practice
- Slow it down, clean it up
- Use a metronome

#### Benchmarks:
- Post at least one performance a month (new or old rep)

## Conclusion
As you can likely tell, I'm being excessively ambitious. I'll likely be uncomfortable. I'll likely fail. That's a good thing. I've found that one of 
my greatest regrets of coming to ISU is that it doesn't take much to excel on paper. It's easy to coast along, not asking what more you can be. I hope 
to change that this year, by focusing more on myself than others. Hopefully I can be proud of myself in the end, since that's all that will matter.
